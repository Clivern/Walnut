# This file is the entry point to configure your own services.
# Files in the packages/ subdirectory configure your dependencies.

        autoconfigure: true # Automatically registers your services as commands, event subscribers, etc.

    # makes classes in src/ available to be used as services
    # this creates a service per class whose id is the fully-qualified class name
